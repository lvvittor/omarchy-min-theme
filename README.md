# Felix - Omarchy Theme
An Omarchy Theme for your Arch Linux / Hyprland setup

A dead simple theme for the digital minimalist. Black & white with space to breath. While also going edge-to-edge on your monitor and not wasting valuable screen real estate. 

10+ extremely subtle backgrounds. No dramatic backgrounds. No clown-color text. No workspace animations. No nonsense.

Einstein & Jobs wore the same thing every day. Now you can too.
